Setting up;

Please scroll down and make sure to fill those sections;
	RootAdmins
	SuperAdmins
	Admins
	Moderators
	VIP
	Bans
	BanLand
	Prefix
	Autosave

Note; Failure to do so BEFORE the first admin initialisation will end up needing a datastorage reset.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Resetting datastorage in-case the previous step hasn't been followed;

Use !resetadmins (SecretKey) twice.
You can get the SecretKey by opening the developer console (F9) and looking for the initialisation message.

and SHUT DOWN.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Usage guide, as almost no one knows how to use the admin for some reason without an explaination;
We will use the !kill command for the examples;

!kill #Number == Kills the player with the stated LPID. You can check the LPIDs in !lpid. Currently the only admin which has this system.
!kill name == Kills the player with the stated name. Doesn't have to be capitalised since V.01.
!kill @me == Kills you.
!kill @others == Kills everyone but you.
!kill @all == Kills everyone.
!kill @admins == Kills anyone who is a Moderator or higher.
!kill @root == Kills all Root(s) or higher.
!kill == Target yourself. Same as !kill @me.

Note; Please explain this system to all of your admins, as this is the only public admin which uses this.

If you want to copy the LPID system over to your own admin, please credit me for it.

This is the prototype loader of Redefine:A v04.
This prototype is not to be confused with R:A v03, as it'll be completely different.
